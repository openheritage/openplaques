# This is an example Database configuration file. 

# You will need to create a database.yml file within the 
# config/ directory to run this application. 

# You can copy the contents of this file to get you started.
# It uses the SQLite database type (which is super-simple).

# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3-ruby (not necessary on OS X Leopard)
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/test.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

# This is an example of using MySQL instead of SQLite:
production:
  adapter: mysql
  database: openplaques
  username: 
  password:
