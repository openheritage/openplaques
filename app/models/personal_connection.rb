# convenient 'join' between the two.
# === Associations
# * Plaque - the plaque on which this commemoration occurs.
# * Person - the person referenced in the commemoration
# * Location - the location referenced in the commemoration (usually the same location as where the plaque is physically located, but this can be different in the case of plaques which commemorate a 'nearby' site or event.).
